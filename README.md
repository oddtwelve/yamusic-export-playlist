# yamusic-export-playlist

Ok, so this is a Google Chrome extension for exporting a playlist from Yandex.Music web pages.

It is NOT made (or meant) to download any music, it simply exports artist, track, album and playlist title from current tab in CSV format for future use. 

You may upload the CSV to Google Music service (I recommend [gmusic-playlist.js](https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist.js)) or use it however you imagine.
